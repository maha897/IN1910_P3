# Project 3 - Chaos Games and Fractals

This repo contains code for chaos games and fractals. Code consists of five python files: triangle.py, chaos_game.py, test_chaos_game.py, fern.py and variations.py. 

Figues and plots generated by the code can be found under the figures directory. I was able to run every code without any issue and was able to get the tests to pass from both my own Windows machine and from an ifi Linux machine.

## Running tests

Tests can be found for chaos_game.py in test_chaos_game.py. It can be run with following 
command:
```
pytest test_chaos_game.py
```
